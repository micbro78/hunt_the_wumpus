Learned about the project and played a recreation of the original Hunt the Wumpus game. We also played a modern and varied version of the game that is arranged in a grid.
Set up the GitHub repository and code space for the project.
Started a cave.py (holds the Cave class) and main.py (to run the program) file.

Defined 3 caves and continued to develop attributes and methods for the cave class.
Created setter and getter methods for each attribute.

5/8/2024
Set up a method of connecting caves using a dictionary associated with each cave object.
Set up link_cave attributes for each cave object and tested.
Don't be a dum-dum. Keep your journal up-to-date and write in your own words please.

Created a method for moving between cave objects.
Created a new character class and instantiated the Wumpus object. Tested 3 of the character attributes.

9/8/2024
Created a new subclass to Character called Enemy and started working on fighting in the game. Added code to character_test to see if the fight method works.
Next session I will integrate the code from character_test into main.
